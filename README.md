# mysqli_checker
Checks that mysqli is on the box and can connect to the database

## usage
 1) update your endpoint details for `$host`, `$username`, `$password`, and `$database_name`
 
 2) copy mysqli_checker.php to your webserver
 
 3) navigate to yourserveraddress.com/mysqli_checker.php


If it all works you should see "Connected" if not relevant error messages to tell you if its a mysqli not installed issue or wrong username/password.
